Build Instructions Infinity Peer Backend v0.1.0
----------------------------------------

XIN services makes extensive use of nodejs. We use if for dependency managemnt, to 
power our builds and to assist in development through auto-recompiling and to power up 
your local development server. Complete installation instructions for nodejs are out 
of the scope of this document since those instructions depend largely on the platform 
you are on.

Windows and Mac users please look at anyone of these links:

https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+nodejs (GIYF)
https://howtonode.org/how-to-install-nodejs

Debian/Ubuntu users please follow these steps

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm

Requirements
------------
 1. You need to install nodejs. For windows download it from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
 2. After installing nodejs and setting path variables, install gulp as a global dependency. 
    Follow the guide here: http://omcfarlane.co.uk/install-gulp-js-windows/
 3. All backends using mongodb as storage endpoint, please refer to: https://www.mongodb.com/
    for OS specific install instructions. The standard install is bind to localhost. In case
    you are running a open mongodb server see the authentication section in main.js.
